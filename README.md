# RunningTracker
Desktop Application for tracking running data sourced from GPS watch.

I have been using SportTracks desktop client to manage all my running data obtained from Garmin GPS watches. 
Unfortunately this has changed to an online subscription model. I want to be able to keep using the data obtained over several years and add to it with new runs.

This is a good opportunity to experiment with using the Avalonia UI framework as well as the latest .NET versions.
